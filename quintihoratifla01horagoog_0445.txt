mention. The positis-e evidence is, that in Set. 11. Π. to (the date oi which ia
restrained, by the circumstances mentioned iu ce. 38, 53, aud 56, to the year
ssdor the end oi 31, ac.) it is utlirmed that his familiarity with Mrecenaa
aerioma in nrrnzero) had commenced less than eight years before, is. in 38
s. c. or 39, at the earliest.

Kirchner (φησει. lieret.) gives a full reviers ot' the circumstances, and
argues strongly for connecting the lter with the treaty os Tarentum. The
difficulty is why Brundisium should be mentioned as the end ol tha journey,
rather than Tarentum. The solution of the difficulty is uo doubt conjectural;
but it is to be borneis mind that the Setire is not an explanatory oue, nor
does it touch on public affairs. Thus, while possibly Brundisium (off which
Antony's lieet had arrived) was the inteisled terminus, Horace, not being a
political friend but merely an amusing compenion, mny well hura beon lest
uland when the place os meeting was altered, while his patron went iorward
to meet Octavian. 1f he werrt on to Tarentum (as ll'olclrenuer, with a refer·
enee to Cerni. 11. 6, supposes him to have done) political reserva might be a
sufficient reason ior his silence on the subject. The opportunity ior humorous
description must hare ended with the arrival at Brundisium.

time occupied is not distinotly expresscd iu tha Satira: Orelli makes it out aa
serenteen days, Gibbon as tuclus, Wnlelrenaer aa iourteen. The distance is
reckoued by the first as all rniles, two days being omitted; by Gibbon aa
