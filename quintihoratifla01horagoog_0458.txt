‘ sia dedi oum Schol. et Codd. aliq. Postquam volsa erant brachia ρτειιεοπ·
‘jam vix poterant sed wsmari, nisi statues ὕστερον πρότερον) Yet the attempt
expreased in prensare seems to oorrespond ιο the adj. batua, i. e. ‘⁴ yieldmg,

69. Tricesima sabbata. This seems most naturally interpreted to mean “ the ³0th

reeltoned imm the first oi September, would sall in the 30th περὶ. Orelli

quotes Roeder's calculation, that from April, tho beginning ol' the Jewiah

sacred year, to October, there would be twenty·five Sabbaths; that iu the

first iourteeu days οι that mouth (the ath) there were, besides the two regular

’ Sabbatha, the two festivals, rin. the Feast oi Trumpets and the Day οι Atoue-

ment (see S. 8. N amb. xxix.) 3 and that, as these festivals are called Sabbatha,

the aoth sabbath would sall on the ensuiug festival, the lst day oi the Fesst

ol Tabernaeles (the 15th oi Tisri.) Orelli adds an anonymam comctiou οἰ

thia praeese, which, by adding iu tha σάββατονΙ δεοτερόῐρωτον (ol' S. Lake, rt.

1) and the Day οἲ Pentecost, makes the 30th Sabbath lull on the lOth day oi

⁷5. Adversarius. Some have supposed this litigant to be different from the oue
'alluded to us radam, in e. 36, sinae that suit would hare been lost by defsult.
But it is easier to suppose one person meant; and the explanation will be,
either that the lis oi a. 37 was not the full amount the defendant would lese
il' nouauited, or that, as Orelli interprete it, the plainiiff was so hot and so seli-
oonfident, aa not ιο be content without open decision in court. On thie sub-
jeot,Lon9'snaieon Cic. Verr. 11. 111. 15. may be consalted. It ha is right
