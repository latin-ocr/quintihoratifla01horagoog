clearly implies that the seheols were closed l'or the tour summer months, trous
the Ides 01 June to those 01 October. His lines are as tollen:

‘Ludi magister parce simplici turba)

‘Albas Leone flammeo calent luces,
‘Tostamque fervens J ullus coquit messem:
‘Cirrata loris horridis Scythas pellis,

‘Qua vapulavit Marsyas Celaeneus,

110000 diem incidunt,¹ (hut this according to Roman calculation is not true.)
2. 'Sira nt ait Lambinus, lduum dies sunt ochi? [0.] 3. ‘De exercitiis
puerorum qui computarent oera,’ 1. e. ‘ques Idibus exigerentur. Octonoe...quia

equivalent to ‘Octobrea’ (There is something plausible in this last, 11 11 be
not en 0000000010ος lor the year in the Augustan age began with January,
nnt March, as anciently.) But the interpretation given first 01 011 10 the best.
The only difficulty is Macrobius' statement that ¹ Martio mense mercedem
exsolvebant magistris quam completus annus deberi feeit,' (Mser. saturn. 1.
12.) But this is done away by Becker’s explanation, that the monthly pay-
ments and the four months’ holiday belonged only to tho poorer and inferior
sehonls. ln the higher schools the payments were annual, and made prob·
ahly in March, aiter the Qttinqrsetrte. He cites Or. Fosi. 111. 829. The verse
