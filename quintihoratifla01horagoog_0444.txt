SATIRE V.

'fuis satireisahurnorous relation of a jouraey to Brundisium, in which
Horace had been invited ιο accompeny Maecenas, who was employed cn a
state embass .

'rho poet isysaid ιο have had for his model a similar satire of Lucilius, fing-
ments of which arc extant, the following verses among others:

‘Verum hinc ludus ibi susque omnia deque fuerunt,

‘ Susque et dequo fuere, inquam, omnia ludn' jocusque ς

‘Illud opus durum, nt Setinum accessimn’ linem,

Ἀιγιλιποι montes, AEtnae omues, asperi Athones!
‘l'o what legation and period ‘the J onrney' belongs, hes been a eenole queste.
Ithas been commonly referred to the convention end treaty of nc. 40, at
Brundisium lt has also been referred to a. c. 38, when Antony came ιο Brun·
disinm ιο meet A7ugnstus. But it is with most reason referred ιο the peace of
Tarentum, n. c. 3 .

After the war of Perusia (which olooed with the sack cf the town, in the
beginning of the year 40, a. c.) there was still danger indicated of an ontbreak
between the triumvirs, arrd of another civil wer. But an accommodatior, in
part helped forward by the death of Fulvia, was arrived et, and the treaty of
Brundisium negotiatcd, by Maecenas, Pellio, and Cocceius. (See liemcule, Her.
cli. nvn. p. 229, sqq.) The interest attaching ιο this peace, the longing for
it at Rome, aad the joy felt when it scemed completed bytho trenty of
Misenum with S. Pompey in the next year, are supposed ιο lind expression
in Virgil’s Bourth Eclogue. (See Mer-iente, pp. 232, 243. 8vo. al.) Sextus,
however, unable ιο enforce his clulius on Achaia, refused ιο fulfil his stipulu-
tions. War again broke out. Octavian renewed through Maecenas his
negotiatione with Antcny, now in Athens, who promised ιο act with him.
But when he appeared oll’ Brundisium with his fleat, he was forbidden to land.
A fresh mediation was needed, and resulted in what is called the treaty of
Tarentum, nc. ³7 (nemete, p. 249); when a scheme of joint action was
concertcd, and a renewel of the triumvirate fer live years engaged lor.

Bor determining the date cf tlre Iler Brundisini n m, it is to be observed that
this Satira gives no assistance 3 it affirma nothing beyond the importante of
the interest-e at stake (c. 28) 3 and that the missiou wne not the first of its
kind (v. 29,) and, incidentally, tbat it was undertakes in the* spring of tho
year. (This is inferrcd from the mention of the “ iroge’ oeneert '¹ in e. 14.)·
On a first view it was natural to connect the occasion of it with the negotie-
tions of a. c. 40, considering the express mention of Brundisium, and the
notoriety and importance of that convention. Accordingly, many commente-
tcrs (and with them a. Η. Β. in the recent Dictioaory of Gecprnplry, art.
‘aromatizat asmgn this date to the flor. But there is evidence, negative
and positive, to show that Horace did not eujey the patronege of llloecenas so
early. Negnfiee, ιοοοοοο, from the battle cf Philippi, fought in Oclcber or
November, a. c. 42, there could be only about fifteen months down to the
period in question. Neai-ly a year elapsed between tho first acquaintance and
the subseqnent intimacy (norw meuse, Sat. 1. vt. 61), aud so less than half a
year would be allowed for the poet's return with the defeated fugitives to
liemc, for his sottling there, gaining his post cf employmcnt, and a lavomnble
