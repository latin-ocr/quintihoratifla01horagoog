Horace, it' he must censure, does it covertly,-he ia ambules, omnus
adbuc (see babv,ep.xu1.e.) That hiem character, however, was want·
ing in fixedness οι purpose, he seems ιο have been uincerely consciens. (See
the mfleoeions in the opening oi Sul. 11. 111. and Set. 11. vu. (re. ita-29.)

This Epistle ia ιο be compared with the Third, being written te one ol the
same snite (where),- pfflbably ιο the mine Celsus as thena mentioned, r, 15.

2. 'ibe marked mention os Tiburin Hersee's later poetry (here, lor instance, and
in Germ. IV. 11. al, IV. ιιι. 10) bas raised the question whether he had any
resideuee there, either lent er leased ιο him. [0.] refers ιο Canu. 11.
xrua 14, aa proving that he hod bnt ene country residence, end that situated
in wnfiuiia ueri Sabini et Tiburtini. But granting that the aner Tiburtinae
may have herdered ou the eeer Sabinus, there is no doubt that Herace's tbrm
uae at least ten or fifteen miles from Tibur itself. In luet, the nearest teun-
ship uus Varie (see Ε. 1. m, 3,) eight miles beyond Tibur. Agnin, the life
attributed to Suetonius speaks of his living ‘plurimum in secessu ruris sni
‘Sabini aut ‘tiburtini’ (cut, “ cr else,” implica that the terme used are not
synonymcns, bnt distinctiva) ‘domusque ejus ostenditur eirca Tiburni luculum!
Again, in Germ. 111. ιν. 22, Horace appears clearly ιο distinguieh his Sabine
residence freni Tibnr; nor does he throu ont ony hint of his Sabine volley
being connected with Tibur, er owing any cbarm ιο it. Compare the detailed
deseiiption in Ε. 1. 16, and the incidental references ιο itin E. 1. xuu.
