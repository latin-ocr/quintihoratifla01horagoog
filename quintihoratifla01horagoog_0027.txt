Parma xi

'Phe order in vvhich the works ol Horace are amelly
printed, via, Odea, Epodes, Satires, Epistles, is apparently
. different from that of their composition. 'l'heir dates, as
conjectmally assigned by Bentley, are given belom and in
spite cf the difficulty of reconciling thern to particular
pamages in the several books, their principle seems tc be ac·
quiesccd ira The question has this principal point os interest
abortit, thatit bears upon Horace's character m a man and
apost, since vvefind, in passing from the Epodea and Satires
to the Odes and Epistles, ahighcr refinement of feeling and
pover of poetry: the harah and objectionable passages of the
first vorhs find no place in the latter: and vvhile the grace·
salness of his lyrica justifies all the claims he makes as
“ Romane fidicen lyrae,” there is no less a grace in the soft
and mellowed ease oi the Epistles oi his declining age.
Moreover (as is shevn in G. Stallbanm's prefaoe to hia
edition) it may he found that the historical events cf the
different perinde account ior the bitternesses and asperities of
the earlier books composed while he vas struggling with
adversity, aod pining under a neglect, from vvhich his genius ,
soon raised him, but to which, for the time, it must have
made him the more sensitiva. And the recollection ot' the
miserico an'sing ont of the anarchy and violence of the Civil
War-—“ quaeque ipse miserrima vidit, et quornm pars magna
fuit’'-might vvell suggest to him the admiration for the
Emperor expressed in the joyiul and adulatory language
which, however excessive to our ears, did not sound so to his
contemporaries.

'Phe Epodes are alluded tc (Ep. 1. xix. 23) as “Parii
iamhil’ This name vas applied to poema in which each
seond verse was shorter than the first (as in elegiae poetry), '
e. p. the lst Epode,-or in which one of the verses vvas made
up of tvo metres of distinct character, as in Epode 13.

'dhe Satires are the “ Gr'aecis intactum carmen,” (Sat. Ι. x.
66) according to the Roman boast oi Quintilian,-“ Satira
