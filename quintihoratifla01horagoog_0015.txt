prevalent errors, suggesting cn outline for· lecturing.
Theu a wish ior fuller detail led to an Appendix, miscel·
laneous, aud, iu some points that required argument,
copious. The present work has a wider range and aim:

minor and elementary notes have been withdrawn, to
make room for new matter, audior the citatione, which
are mostly substituted for mere references. ⁸

I trust the execution oi the whole will prove worthy
oi 'the sanction you extend to it. You are not of course
answerable for my shortcomings3 but your name, thus
placed at the head, may weh be received as a general
gunrantee that the plan has not been hastily or heedlessly
undertahcn.

I am,
Vcry thankfully and sinocrcly yours,
JOHN EYRE YONGE.
