tota nostra est,” (X. ι. 93), a kind ol poetry firat struck out
by Ennius (“Ennius aostcr‚” Cic. pro Arch. vm. 10.), fol-
lowed, at some interval, and with a differenee in the treat-
ment ol the subject, by Lucilius. 'l'he name is derived stom

“ “ satur,'’ the miscellaneous character of the subjecta being

eompared to the “ satura lanx,” i. e. the diah oi various truite
offered as aaacrifice, or firsthuits3 and then coming to siguify
any “ hash ” or “ olio.'’ So Juvenal describes hia work aa a
“ sarrago‚’' and “quidquid agunt homines'' as its legitimate
materiale to work up.

The odes, on the contrary, are formed on the Greek type,
and some, no doubt, directly adapted from Greek originale,
keeping even the Greek names. From them it ia we der-ive
our ohiel knowledge ol the Alcaic and Sapphic merres, for we
have but disjointed fragments of their first authors3 but as
far as we can compare them, Horace seems to have improved
upon his medela, in point of metrical* harmony as well as
precision,-a merit in which he ¹may be contrasted with
Ovid, who, however remarkable lor the variety of eadence
and rhythm in his verse, is lar inferior to the Greek elegiaats.
'lhe restriction, no doubt suited to the genius of the Latin
language‚ hampera it nevertheless in his poems, and loses all
the flexibility and ease, and much of the grace, of his models.
We have slew lyrio odes from Catullus3 but whether they
had less circulation, or were less formally published in books,
they are not considered to interfere, by their simple priority
of time, with Horaoe's claim of being the first introducar into
Italy of the AEolian strains. '

'Phe Epistles are probably, of all Horaoe's werke, the most
admired3 and they ere those which seem to place us most at
home with the author, end to give the most pleasing reden of
his character. Otherwise, they maybe classed generally with
his Satires, as a sort ol continuation oi them, but with the
, sostened and easy style betokening inward' satisfaction, pros.
