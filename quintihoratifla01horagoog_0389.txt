rt seru clero...delcbentis. For alveo Orelli reads oeqrwre. It is very difficolt tc
decide which word hes the best claim to be admitted into the text. The best
MSS. are quoted ior aleces several heve equore, with alveo written over· as e
V. L.; others, atreo with apere us a V. L. Orelli prefers equore as the more
difficnlt reading, involving a rerer usage, and therefore the less likely to
have been accidentally introduoed, and the more likely to have boen explained;
end he conceires clueo to beu gloss. To this it may be objected, that alveo is
not s natural gloss for aquom ,- itis not synonymons with it. ‘Alam' is “ tho
thornei or ted os the river,” not the river itselt'. I can find but one passage ,
where clears exchanges its proper sense of chamuel ior that oi rheam, rix. in
(idun. V. 111. 2,-clernerttiore alveo.- though I allow that, in the one other
titilitiitgtitnlttrilffirstnlzltshtltsiritii
inritamina cr equore. (We may even edd γίνῃ. 0. 1. 203.) But, considering
the extreme rarity of this usage, itis as likely that oeqnm might be added as
aglons to alveo (however incorrectly) as the contrary. I say incorrectly, sor
lconclude that medic alveo here means simply ‘⁴ donet the mid clionnel,’¹ and
marn os no such poetic enallage es ‘Tusco slveo' does. Another supposition
luperhaps admissible. viz. that the poet himself hesitated between the two
words (there are two instantes of snch curre secunde in scrip. Medea, 300 arrd
1314), between equoreas the more poetical, and alveo as the more correct
phrase. In Vir-9. AEn. rur. 86 and 96, which Orelli qnotcs in support of his
reading, the context supplies u special ground ior the adoption of necor, which
rond not apply here. Tiber is there represented as calming ¹his ewelling tide,
for AEueas’ saka, to the stillness ot' a lake—‘In morem stagni placidaeque
paludis Sterneret aeqnor· aquis,' and the bont glidcs on ‘placido aequore.¹ No
other substantive would so fitly express the warelcss level of the stream.
