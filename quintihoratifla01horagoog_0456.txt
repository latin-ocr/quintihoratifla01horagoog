ltoliere, in the first Scene ot Les riolas. Compare too Ben Joneoa, sse
Ροοιωια, Act 111. Sc. 1. Iu the course ot' the dialogus, incidentally‚ isasserted
the honourable and iudi-pendent relation which existed between the poet and
hia patron. There is a carious and difficnlt allusion ιο the Jews iu c. 89.
