'l’his is one οἰ the most remarkable ot' ull Horaoe¹s poema, both in its
politiosl snd its poetis chuaoter. Politioally considered, the sentimenta oi
despair and the proposal of abandoning Italy are foreign (as Walehenser re·
marks, eol. 1. p. 82, liir. 11.16) to the true Roman temper, and imply sn ex.
tinotion oi the old republican spirit. A proposal, indeed, ol the kind had
found supporters atter the defeat at Canum bnt it was ohecked at onoe (Lim
1111. 53), and punished atterum by the Censor (hio. xm. la) These
sentimenta oontrast strongly with those of other odes; ay. 0. 111. ιιι. in
which, atter enlogies on sn nndannted and constant mind, the poet is thought
to be protesting against any translation of the imperial power oi Rome; or
thosein which one ruler and one restorer oi law and order is mengnised,
honoured, and trusted3 as in C. 1. 11. 25, som 0. 111. Π. 37, ηας 111. mr.
27. In this Epode the sppeul lios to the community and the general opinion
(vv.15,³9.) And this view of the poem falls in with the very early date
assigned to it,-s date when the poet was at the lowest ebb oi his fertones,
and saw nothing bnt despair 3 or, is he had just begnn to reoorer himself, and
congratulate himself on his personal escape and his return to Rome, he might
ahndder at a heah ontbreak οἰ war, and the possible reversal ol' all hopes ol*
public or private waltare. Walckenaer iniere an early date ior the poem, trem
the character ei the poetry. He finds indicatione οἲ s youthiul unpractised
author in the extent of details, the length and luxurianoe oi description. He
allows, however, that ‘la grand po'e'te s'y owatrs tout atter! 'l'he metro ohoeen,
a combination oi hexameter and pune senarian iambis, has a stately humony,
suited to grave, earnest thoughts, and passing no less easily inte a flow of
happy aspiratione. ‘Cette ode dnt plaire i oea dines gonerenaes et donnes qni,
‘dans les mans de laur patrie, ne trouvent de distractions i leur tristeess qne
‘dans les rtves de la poesie et dans lea fantaisies de l'imagination.' 'l'hem is
a tine paraphrase and application oi the latter part os this Epode in the Rev.
Isaao Williams’ Christian Scholor.
