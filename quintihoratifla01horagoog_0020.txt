plaintive character of the poetry gives it a point ofunion with
medem feeling.

I pass rather to the critical question respecting the form
and structure of his Lyrios, and Ι extract (both for its own
value, and as my authority for printing the Odes as 1 do
without headings) the following passages from an essay by
Buttmann, translated in Vol. 1. of the Philelcpical Murcum,
p. 441 :-

“ Fau the largest part of the titles tolloraee’s poema consist of ad,
with the name of the person to whom the poem is addrest. 'l'bis is
just our own mode, which we ascribe to the aucieuts, by which a dedi·
cation becomes an empty form, devoid of any real meaning. ‘l'he
ingenious practice of the anoieuts iu speaking on a matter which
touched their beart nearly, was to fancy that some person, whom they
loved or esteemed‚ was standing by them, and to shape their thoughts
as if they were talking to him. This could not be exprest iu a better
or livelier way than by a simple vocative, which they introduced iu a
suituble place, but the pleasing effect of which is altogether missed, if
we have already had to read the name at full length at the head of the
poem. Let a person for instance only read the Odes to Fuscus aud to
Postumus (I. xxr1. ; II. x1v.) and he will leel the truth of my assertiou.

‘⁸ When Horace, in copying a pretty Greek poem, such as in Ode
l. xv111. readers it word for word iu tbis manner,

Nullam, Vere, sacra vite prius severis arborem,
one clearly sees that his sole view in this address was to give his imita·
tion a livclier air; and that a title, which makes the poem look like a
poeticel epistle actually sent to Varus, and called forth by some real
occurrence, is a complete absurdity.

“From thcse remarks, itis clear in the first place, that, like every
title of whatever kind, which points out the object of a poem any
further than that object is distinotly and fully exprest in the poem
itself, every dedicatory title, which is not grounded ou a vocative of
this sort, is utterly wrong, and has grown out ol some bluudcr or some
arbitrary interpolation. ⁸ ⁸ ⁸ ⁸

“The absurdity of the present titles, taken collectively, appears
also from this-that, while as we have just seen, the accidental occur-
rence ola vocative in au odeis made the ground for heading it with a
name very slightly, if at all, connected with its subject ; when the poet
ou the other hand couches his thoughts in such a form, that the name
he is doing honour to appears only in the third person, although the
whole cde relates to him, like that ou Numida’s return (1. xxxva) it
ia still left without any title, as if it were on some gcueral topic.
